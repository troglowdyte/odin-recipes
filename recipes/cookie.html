        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I don't think there is much to say here. Who doesn't love cookies. Though they aren't the most filling or nutritous,
        certainly are the most delicious. Enjoy how they crumble in your mouth... and don't forget the milk.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Wheat</li>
            <li>1 Cocoa Beans</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 1 wheat to left square of middle row.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cocoa beans to middle square of middle row.</li>
            <li>Add 1 wheat to right square of middle row.</li>
            <li>Voila! You have delicious cookies. Enjoy.</li>
